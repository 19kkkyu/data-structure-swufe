# Trees
Linked lists and array-based lists work well for representing *linear* relationships, but not all relationships are linear. In this chapter, we are going to investigate one of the most *nonlinear* data structures: **trees**.

As the name implies, it looks like a tree, containing *roots*, *branches*, and *leaves*. In trees, items are organized in **hierarchical** way, with some nodes being "above" and some "below" others. 

A tree is a geneal and natural model to describe the world. Just to name a few:

- Animals can be classified into 2 main groups: *vertebrates* and *invertebrates*. Vertebrates can even classified into *warm-blooded* and *cool-blooded*, while invertebrates can classified into: *with jointed legs* and *without legs*.

- HTML can be nested. For example, `<html>` is the root tag, and it has two major nested elements: `<head>` and `<body>`. Inside the head, typical elements include `<title>` and `<style>`; while inside the body, typical elements include `<h1>`, `<p>`.
