# Exercise
1. Please implement Python's counterpart of List's [int lastIndexOfâ€‹(Object o)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#lastIndexOf(java.lang.Object)).

```python
def last_index_of(a: list, e) -> int:
    pass
```

2. Please implement your own *ArrayList* based on an array in Java. To make sure that your APIs are consistent, please let your class implement [java.util.List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html) interface.


```java
public class MyArrayList<E> implements List<E> {
    ...
}
```
