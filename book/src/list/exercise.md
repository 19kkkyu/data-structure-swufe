# Exercise
1. Please implement Python's counterpart of List's [int lastIndexOf​(Object o)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#lastIndexOf(java.lang.Object)).

```python
def last_index_of(a: list, e) -> int:
    pass
```

---
2. Please implement your own *ArrayList* based on an array in Java. To make sure that your APIs are consistent, please let your class implement [java.util.List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html) interface.


```java
public class MyArrayList<E> implements List<E> {
    ...
}
```

3. Try to implement the selection sort algorithm based on the pseudo code using Java or Python.

---
4. Please analyze the time complexity of the selection sort algorithm.

---
5. Try to write the pseudo code of inserting an item at index `i` on a linked list as [set​(int index, E element)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#set(int,E)).


---
6. Try to write the pseudo code of clearing a linked list.

---
7. Please design an algorithm to convert a linked list to an array in Python.

---
8. Please try to implement a stack based on singly linked lists using an inner `Node` class in Python.
