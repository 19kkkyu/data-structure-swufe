# Lists
Lists are fundamental data structures, and we have used its *array* based version (e.g., `ArrayList` in Java and `list` in Python) in the daily programming tasks. What's more, the previous `stacks`, `queues` and `deques` are also in fact based on a list. 

In this chapter, we will investigate lists in a comprehensive way. Particularly, a challenging structure called *linked list* will be introduced.
