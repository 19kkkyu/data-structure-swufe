# LinkedList
Different from an array based list, a linked list can be stored in non-contiguous memory, so this ADT performs well when we insert or remove an element at some position in a list because no any shifting is required. Of course, it has trade-offs. Since it is not contiguous, index-based retrieving is less efficient for a linked list ADT, because we have to scan the whole list at the worst case.

A typical illustration of a (singly) linked list is like:

more complex data structures throughout the book, so you should read this section
carefully, even if you have experience working with linked lists.

As we can see, a linked list consists of a sequence of *nodes*, and the previous node has a link pointing to the next one. The following is working definition for linked lists:

> A linked list is a **recursive** data structure that is either empty (`null`) or a
reference to a node having an item and a reference to a linked list.

With object-oriented programming, implementing linked lists is not difficult. We start with a class that defines the node abstraction:

```java
class Node {
    Item item;
    Node next;
}
```

```python
class Node:
    def __int__(self, item, next=None):
        self.item = item
        self.next = next
```

As for the linked list shown in the figure, we can use the following code:

```python
first = Node(1)
second = Node(9)
third = Node(8)
first.next = second
second.next = third
```

From the definition, we can know that one is able to use the first node (`first` in our case) to represent a whole linked list, and the first node often is known as `head`. As for the procedure-oriented programming language (e.g., C), this is only  way to design a linked list.

To what follows, I will describe the common methods for a linked list ADT in a procedure-first way, and we are going to translate those pseudo code into Python or Java code in the following sections. 

## `size()`: the number of elements

The idea is straightforward: scanning the linked list from `head`, and stop util we reach a `null`.

In practice, this method is not necessary due to its inefficiency (\\(O(N)\\)), and we can store its size an attribute directly. Since adding a `size` is trivial, and for the ease of description, we will not show how to use and update `size` attribute in the pseudo code.

## `isEmpty()`: return true if there is no any element

One solution is to check whether its size is 0. The following shows an equivalent approach with the constant time complexity:

## `addFirst()`: add an element at the beginning

The main idea is that we create a new node with the new element, set its `next` link to refer to the current `head`, and set the listâ€™s `head` to point to the new node.

This figure illustrates (a) before the insertion; (b) after a new node is created and linked to the existing head; (c) after reassignment of the head reference to the newest node.

Recall that adding an element to an array cost \\(O(n)\\), but this algorithm costs only \\(O(1)\\).

## `addLast()`: add an element at the end
The last position is also known as `tail`. If the linked list also maintains the `tail` node, then the implementation is trivial: just update the `tail` reference itself to the newly created node.

But we have to consider another corner case: **when the linked list is empty, both `head` and `tail` is null, so it is illegal to use `tail.next = newest`**.

> We need to care about whether a node is null when designing algorithms for linked list ADT.

Additionally, if we introduce a `tail` for a linked list, the algorithm for adding an element should be updated accordingly. Readers can also explore how to add an element at the end of a linked list if `tail` is not stored.
