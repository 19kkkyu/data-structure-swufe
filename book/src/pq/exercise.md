# Exercise
1. Please implement `MaxPQ` based on an unordered array and ordered array, respectively.
---
2. Do exercise 1 using a linked list.
---
3. Please prove that the height of a complete binary tree of size N is \\(\lfloor \lg{N} \rfloor\\).
---
4. Please implement the minimum binary heap (`MinPQ`).
---
5. Please design an algorithm to test whether a maximum binary heap is valid.
---
6. Given the `Book` class, please compare books by the price first, and then by the length of titles if the prices are identical.
---
7. Please implement the `MaxPQ` with a user-defined comparator in Python.
---
8. Please implement a binary heap using explicit links. Hint: you shall use *left*, *right*, and *parent* as we did in a RBT.
---
9. How to use [PriorityQueue](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/PriorityQueue.html) or [heapq](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html) as a minimum heap?
---
10. Please design an algorithm to sort a list based on the heap.
