# Hash Tables
In [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/fundamentals.md), we have learned how to use `HashMap` in Java, and *dictionaries* in Python. Essentially, they are all implemented with **hash tables**. 

> Hashing is an extremely effective and practical technique: the basic dictionary operations require only \\(O(1)\\) time on the average. 

In this chapter, we mainly focus on three dictionary operations:

- *search*
- *insert*
- *delete*

Like a BST, we mainly focus on *keys*, so the ADT is a **set**. If we also consider the *values*, then it is a **symbol table** (a.k.a., map).
