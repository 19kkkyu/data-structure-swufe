## A few notes for installing Python
As for MacOS, Python 3 is a built-in software, so in general, you do not have to install it again. Of course, if you would like to do something with machine learning and deep learning in the future, [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Annoconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads) is preferred.

As for Windows, you can install Python 3 from sources in the following:

- [Python 3 Official](https://www.python.org/downloads/): recommended for beginners
- [Annoconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads): recommended for intermediates
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html): recommended for experts

During the installation, **it is fine to always click *Next* and use the default settings if you don't know what they mean**.

[^virtual] Python virtual environment is a very useful tool to isolate your developing settings.
